# 50.003-ESC_g_3_8

For this project, we are going to perform a Progressive Web App to serve the purpose of being able to work across multiple devices. Visual Studio Code can be used. Alternatively, we can also choose jetbrains Webstorm to do so. 

## Installation setup 
To do the web app we are going to use Node to execute the project.

 ### For Mac users
 First, open up the terminal or the shell to carry out and execute the process. 
 
     brew update

 Second, install node using the following commands.
 
     brew install node 
     
 Third, check your node and npm version using either of the following commands.
 
     node -v
     npm -v
     
 You should be able to see a version of node being at least 8.10 and npm version to be at least 5.6 for react to work.
     
 Fourth, if all of the above is set, ya ready to go! Run the following commands to ensure that everything is working. Before you do so, make a new directory for the new react app using mkdir system call.
 
     npx create-react-app my-app
     
     cd my-app 
     
     npm start 
 You should be able to see a running web page on your local host.
